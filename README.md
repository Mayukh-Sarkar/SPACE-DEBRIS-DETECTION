# SPACE-DEBRIS-DETECTION
This was a part of my project work in making a space debris collision avoidance system.
First input your debris image in the imagepro.m to get  the image boundaires and  image processiong data.
Secondly input a test orbit in the gibbs.m method code to get the orbit of the debris field.
Use the craft orbit and debris orbit and input it in projectV1.m to and alternate orbit.
USe gibbs to determine the orbit prameter.
Use orbit.m to plot the orbits.
Use hohmann.m to dtetermine the orbit transfer.
Use orientation.m to get the RCS.
Use oms.m to get the OMS data
